* New .cc file for one-chain system
---
* Can choose mu quench or density quench
* Rewrite the code using combination of single-chain bases
---
* Put all the scatterer sites as well as the charge site together
*Compute the entanglement entropy by pulling out a sub-chain in MPS, which is efficient when the scatterer size is large.
---
* 4 leads, two Kitaev chains
* The excited state of the two Kitaev chains is the excited state of the first chain product the ground state of the second chain
