Put all the scatterer sites as well as the charge site together

Compute the entanglement entropy by pulling out a sub-chain in MPS, which is efficient when the scatterer size is large.

4 leads, two Kitaev chains

The excited state of the two Kitaev chains is the excited state of the first chain product the ground state of the second chain
